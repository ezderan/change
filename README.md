# Voxel War
New PvP shooter in voxel style(remade version of CapsuleWar)
Last month ago I saw interesting project in GitHub called CapsuleWar(next CW) but when I saw what we had in clear version I decided to rechanged all in personal voxel style.
And now here we go)
Every one who wants to write personal opinion on what he/she wants to see in this game can do in special file called ALL_IDEAS 

# What I want to change here:
I have not so much idea:
- Change personage and make animations for each personage
- Remake amount of bullets in Sniper because 2 bullets in 1 magazine is only for businessman))
- Change 3d model of all Riffles, Pistol and Smg
- Add new weapons
- Remake changing riffle(meybe add shop menu like on Valorant or in CS:GO)
- REWRITEEE ALL SCRIPTS(in CW all scripts was written so not understanding (meybe only for me))
- Make this game for Android and IOS too

# What now we have:
- Remaded map
- Max connected players on one ip - 10(in CW was 5)
- Textured all elements
- Optimised for all PC(PC with Nvidia GeForce GT 520 can have 60 fps or higher)

# Where I can download this:
In next changing i will drop remaded version #1-0-2a but if you want to test this version just write me on Instagram(@e7deran) with text "I want your game"(because my bot can in this side send a link for dowloading)
